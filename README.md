**Predicting-Stock-Prices-Using-Different-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Models**

This project delves into the intricate challenge of forecasting daily closing prices and stock movements of Amazon, a global corporate giant known for its dynamic and unpredictable stock behavior. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of factors influencing Amazon's stock prices, this study employs a holistic approach to provide accurate and reliable forecasts, transcending traditional prediction methodologies. Specifically, comparing the performance of three distinct machine learning and deep learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) on financial time series data. The dataset utilized in this analysis spans from January 2, 2005, to August 21, 2019, encompassing a significant period of Amazon's stock history. By leveraging this extensive dataset, the project aims not only to deliver precise predictions but also to elucidate the methodologies and techniques employed in stock price forecasting. This includes an in-depth exploration of the nuances associated with each model, offering a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and limitations. The comparative analysis presented in this research contributes valuable insights into the challenges of predicting stock prices within a dynamic and ever-changing market environment. The evaluation and contrast of results from the Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-Layered Perceptron models serve as a benchmark for understanding the intricacies of utilizing machine learning techniques in stock market forecasting.
